# 🛣️ Souls Stack Roadmap | Plasma MXI (02Souls)

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a modular robotic system that interprets biological signals (simulated or real) and responds using AI-based behavior control.

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Simulation Brain Loop

- [x] `fake_oscillator.py` — Simulated slime mold voltage data
- [x] `response_tree.py` — Maps voltage to movement decisions
- [ ] Visual dashboard for behavior over time
- [ ] Sample animation or behavior log output

---

## ⚙️ Phase 1: Firmware & Hardware Integration

- [ ] `slime_bot.ino` — Arduino firmware to map AI actions → servos/motors
- [ ] Define modular robot shell (printable or COTS platform)
- [ ] Breadboard prototype: light, heat, or touch sensors → behavior mapping

---

## 🧬 Phase 2: Real Biointerface Development

- [ ] Signal bridge from living slime mold or yeast cultures
- [ ] Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) signal sampling
- [ ] Map natural oscillations to control states

---

## 🤝 Contribute

Looking for:
- Roboticists, embedded systems engineers, bioengineers
- Makers and prototypers interested in co-intelligent machines
- Experimental biologists and open-source weirdos
